This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Sekulic V, Chen TC, Lawrence JJ, Skinner FK (2015) Dendritic
distributions of I h channels in experimentally-derived
multi-compartment models of oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-LM)
hippocampal interneurons. Front Synaptic Neurosci 7:2

These files were contributed by V Sekulic.

This model will also be available in Open Source Brain
(<a href="http://opensourcebrain.org">http://opensourcebrain.org</a>).

MODEL USAGE
-----------

Before running the model, compile the mod files appropriately, according
to your operating system. For example, in Unix/Linux, run the ``nrnivmodl''
command from within the top-level model directory.

Then run one of the provided bash scripts in order to load the parameters for
one of the four models used in the Sekulic et al. (2015) paper, as follows:

Model R3: ./startup_R3.sh
Model R4: ./startup_R4.sh
Model S3: ./startup_S3.sh
Model S4: ./startup_S4.sh

Following that, fitted parameters as per Sekulic et al. (2015) may be loaded
by calling the ``load_file'' function in NEURON, providing as argument one
of the .ses files in one of the two subdirectory trees:

04525047--90nA
04610022--90nA

The directories correspond to fitted session files against the experimental
O-LM current clamp recordings for, respectively, cell 4525#4 and 4610#2 (as
described in the Sekulic et al., 2015 paper).

The filenames for the session files provide information as to what part of
the Sekulic et al. (2015) paper they were used for. For instance, the file

04525047--90nA/uniform-RmGr/dendIh_uni_RmCmTau_Starfish_hD1_3.ses

was obtained as part of the fitting procedure for uniform ("uni") dendritic
Ih distributions for the Starfish morphology (S3) with dendritic Ih 
("hD1"). See ``Session Filename Legend'' below for a catalogue of the
filename elements to aid in identification of any given session file.

This session (see figure 3 in the paper) starts with these settings:

and then after the optimize button is pressed (takes 140 minutes to
run on a MacBookPro):

<img src="./screen1.png" alt="screenshot1" width="600">

The experimental recordings used for the fitting procedures were obtained from
the following paper:

Lawrence, J.J., Statland, J.M., Grinspan, Z.M., and McBain,
C.J. (2006). Cell type-specific dependence of muscarinic signalling in
mouse hippocampal stratum oriens interneurones. J. Physiol. 570,
595â€“610. doi:10.1113/jphysiol.2005.100875

The maximum conductance densities of the four models (R3, R4, S3, and S4)
were selected from highly-ranked models in the ensemble modelling approach
done as part of the following paper:

Sekulic, V., Lawrence, J.J., and Skinner, F.K. (2014). Using Multi-compartment
ensemble modeling as an investigative tool of spatially distributed biophys-
ical balances: application to hippocampal Oriens-Lacunosum/Moleculare
(O-LM) cells. PLoSONE 9:e106567. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106567

SESSION FILENAME LEGEND

General structure of filenames (all caps correspond to modifiable elements):

dendIh_DISTRIB_FITS_MORPHOLOGY_DENDIH_PARAMSET.ses

The elements can take on the following values:

Element		Meaning				Possible values	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIB		The distribution of Ih used	uni - uniform
						sig - sigmoidal
						lin - linear

FITS		Which passive properties	Rm - specific membrane resistivity
		were fitted (additive; so	Cm - specific membrane capacitance
		multiple values mean each	Tau - time constant of activation of Ih
		corresponding property was	Sf - scaling factor (for initial Gh)
		allowed to vary).

MORPHOLOGY	Which reconstructed model	Richy - "cell 1" in Sekulic et al (2015) paper
		morphology was used (these	Starfish - "cell 2" in Sekulic et al (2015) paper
		were obtained from the 
		Lawrence et al 2006 paper)

DENDIH		Whether dendritic Ih was	hD0 - no dendritic Ih (only somatic Ih)
		present				hD1 - somatodendritic Ih present

PARAMSET	Which rank of the model		3 - rank 3 of the Richy or Starfish database subsets.
		database from Sekulic et	4 - rank 4 of the Richy or Starfish database subsets.
		al (2014) the maximum
		conductance densities of the
		ionic conductances were 
		obtained from. Used in 
		conjunction with the morphology
		to determine the model from
		the database, e.g., R3, S4.
